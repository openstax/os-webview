				<p class="text-block">Teaming up with the other OpenStax Institutional Partner schools provided a sense of community as we navigated launching OER initiatives at our own campuses. Learning about other schools’ successes and frustrations each month was inspiring. I learned so many new techniques and innovative ideas that I could then apply at my own campus. I loved the structure of this program. It’s inspiring to see how many students are impacted by OER adoption – the numbers really add up quickly.</p>

				<p class="text-block">With guidance we received through the Institutional Partner program, we were able to strategically plan events and presentations to increase faculty awareness of Open Educational Resources, resulting in more than a dozen new OER adoptions.  We anticipate that number will significantly increase again as we enter the second year of the program.</p>
