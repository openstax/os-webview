				<p class="text-block">Teaming up with the other OpenStax Institutional Partner schools provided a sense of community as we navigated launching OER initiatives at our own campuses. Learning about other schools’ successes and frustrations each month was inspiring. I learned so many new techniques and innovative ideas that I could then apply at my own campus. I loved the structure of this program. It’s inspiring to see how many students are impacted by OER adoption – the numbers really add up quickly.</p>
