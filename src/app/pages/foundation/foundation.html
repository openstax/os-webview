                    Calvin K. Kazanjian was the founder and president of Peter Paul
                    (Almond Joy), Inc. He firmly believed that the more people
                    understood about basic economics the happier and more prosperous
                    they would be. Accordingly, he established the Calvin K. Kazanjian
                    Economics Foundation Inc, in 1949 as a philanthropic, nonpolitical
                    educational organization to support efforts that enhanced economic
                    understanding.
