                        provided a sense of community as we navigated launching OER initiatives
                        at our own campuses. Learning about other schools’ successes and
                        frustrations each month was inspiring. I learned so many new techniques
                        and innovative ideas that I could then apply at my own campus. I loved
                        the structure of this program.
