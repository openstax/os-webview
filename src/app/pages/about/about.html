            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it's our mission to
                improve student access to education. Our first open source college
                textbook was published in 2012 and has since scaled to more than 20 books used by
                hundreds of thousands of students across the globe. Our adaptive learning
                technology, designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized
                educational paths, is currently being piloted for K-12 and college.
                The OpenStax mission is made possible through the generous support of
                philanthropic foundations. Through these partnerships and our alliance
                with other educational resource companies, OpenStax is breaking down the
                most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors
                to succeed.
