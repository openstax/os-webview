                description: `Persistent disparities in education, especially for historically underrepresented and marginalized students, continue to limit access to quality learning. Financial burdens and a lack of resources in communities facing systemic barriers often stand in the way of academic success and future opportunities, reinforcing an inequitable status quo. 
    
    
    For 25 years, OpenStax has been disrupting this status quo by offering free, high-quality educational resources that break down these barriers. With an equity-centered approach, we collaborate with educators to create culturally relevant, adaptable content that meets the needs and strengths of students from diverse backgrounds. By challenging traditional publishing models, we enhance learning and help reduce student debt. 
    
    
    As a result, the textbook market is shifting. According to economist Mark Perry, “The deflation of the ‘textbook bubble’ is primarily driven by the creative disruption and competitive edge of free or affordable textbooks, as exemplified by OpenStax.” 
    (Mark Perry, AEI, 2019).`,
