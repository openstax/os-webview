We want to build a strong community of institutions who are working together to develop a deeper understanding of what can be done with OpenStax and the larger ecosystem of OER materials.</p><p>This year, we’re looking to work with institutions who are interested in launching or expanding OER initiatives on their campuses to promote a wider and richer engagement with open materials. Our incoming institutional partners will join our community of over 50 partner schools who work together to share strategies, discuss challenges, and celebrate wins.</p><p>This year’s institutions will be selected during a competitive application process in July. Each institution admitted into the program will work with us to learn new strategies and apply them to their campus. Calls and emails with the community of institutions provide peer-to-peer support, guidance, and accountability. In addition, all partner institutions will receive free access to our OpenStax Tutor platform for their students.</p><p>If you are an existing OpenStax Institutional Partner and wish to participate in the updated program, <a href=\"https://forms.gle/rv2MWXCVbLt1nnnu5\"><b>sign up here</b></a><b>.</b></p><p>If you are a first time applicant to the OpenStax Institutional Partnership, <a href=\"/institutional-partnership-application\"><b>apply here</b></a><b>!</b></p>",

Learning about other schools’ successes and frustrations each month was inspiring. I learned so many new techniques and innovative ideas that I could then apply at my own campus. It’s inspiring to see how many students are impacted by OER adoption — the numbers really add up quickly.",
