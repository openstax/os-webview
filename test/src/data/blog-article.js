            "value": "<p>My initial college experience was like a stock photo. You see these people smiling at everything as if it’s the most interesting and fun thing ever, but when you actually think about it, what’s really happening and what the camera captures are not the same. When I was in high school and watched movies about college, I saw it as a place of freedom and fun were I could hang out with friends all the time and go on crazy adventures. Fast forward four years, and I look back and laugh at the naiveté of the clueless high school senior I was.</p><p>What pop media doesn’t really tell you about college is that it’s rough. You’re suddenly thrown into a new environment, left to take care of yourself and decide how to manage your time and money without any guidance. For me, time management was especially rough when it came to academics. In high school, I took numerous AP classes at once, juggled extracurriculars, and still managed to do well in school. I assumed college would be the same. But as it turned out, balancing my time between academics, clubs, and friends without the structure that high school provided and the “encouraging” nagging of my mom was like drinking from a fire hose.</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to experience what many college students go through at one point in their lives: burnout. It was something I couldn’t control, and it made me want to quit everything altogether because of the sheer energy it took to maintain my life and responsibilities, even at the bare minimum. This has happened to me many times, so much that whenever I hear the word “burnout” I immediately picture myself and the millions of students who experience it every day.</p><p>Why am I suddenly talking about my past experience with student exhaustion on a blog post about open education? Don’t worry, it all loops back around.</p><p>Today, the final day of the Open Education conference, I went about my sessions thinking that I now knew all the basics about OER and the different ideas, components, and issues that surround it. At 4 p.m., I walked into my last session of the day and proceeded to be wrong once again. This session, <i>Is Open Education Hurting You? Exploring the Health of the Open Ed Community and its Participants,</i> presented by Lauri Aesoph, discussed the intersection of health, wellness, and open education, something that I had not seen at the conference until today.</p><p>Lauri talked about how we can keep people who contribute to the OER community going, and how individual health can fit into and/or affect the health of the open education community. Having taken classes about public health, I was familiar with the terminology and research she presented. However, what I wasn’t familiar with was the conversation about health in the OER community. In the past couple decades, the professional environment has changed tremendously. The typical work setting has evolved to become more knowledge-based, which requires a continuous need to learn, especially with new technology developing every year. There’s a fast-paced environment that includes less personal interaction, thanks to advances in email, social media, and video calling. These factors put stress on instructors that can lead to health problems.</p><p>How do we make sure that open education isn’t hurting OER contributors as they spend hours creating new content and material to support the community? I knew about student burnout, but this was the first time I had considered instructor burnout.</p><p>Because I am a student, I am considered one of the beneficiaries of OER, and I think many of us take it for granted. Yes, OER is amazing and I am grateful it exists, but what are we, as the community that benefits from OER, doing to ensure that those who give are not being overwhelmed by the stress of continuous contribution?</p><p>This is a question that I don’t know the full answer to, but I hope that the OER community grows to understand that this is not a one-way street. Open education doesn’t have to flow from a contributing instructor to a receiving student. With open pedagogy, students can contribute to OER. With faculty learning communities, instructors can collaborate to produce content together. With cross-institutional initiatives, colleges from across the nation can work together to create a system of openness. We may each have different roles, but we all share in an important task: helping to maintain the OER movement. That is what I plan to do. My knowledge of OER is still small, but I know my future in it is not.</p>"
