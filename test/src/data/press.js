                answer: '<p data-block-key="duy3m">OpenStax has longstanding partnerships with philanthropic foundations like Arnold Ventures, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, William &amp; Flora Hewlett Foundation, as well as public funders like the National Science Foundation and Texas Higher Ed Coordinating Board, who provide the funding to create peer-reviewed, openly licensed resources and technology. OpenStax also generates earned revenue through print sales of their textbooks and mission support fees from for-profit edtech partners who provide optional resources, such as homework solutions that wrap around OpenStax content. This sustainable business model helps ensure that OpenStax textbooks are always up-to-date and available to instructors and students for free.
