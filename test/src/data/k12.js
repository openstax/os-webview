Review the textbook online, and if you decide to use it in your class, <a href="https://openstax.org/adoption">let us know</a>. To access instructor-only materials, you can create an OpenStax account and request faculty access. Once we manually verify that you&#x27;re an instructor, you will have access to all faculty content. Include the textbook URL in your course materials, and from there, students can choose how they want to view the book.</p><p data-block-key="3aluh">If you&#x27;re a student, simply access the web view, download a PDF, or purchase a hard copy via Amazon or your campus. Even students whose professors have not adopted OpenStax are welcome to use OpenStax textbooks.</p>',

We revise our books when it is pedagogically necessary; we may publish a new edition to accommodate significant developments in the field, while smaller updates are made regularly in the web view of your book. Each June, OpenStax publishes new PDFs and print versions for most of our books to reflect these updates (when substantial changes are present).</p>',

                slug: 'Are OpenStax resources designed for higher education or secondary education?',
                answer: '<p data-block-key="3at1q">Founded on a belief that students should have access to high-quality educational materials without incurring cost, OpenStax created a line of free, peer-reviewed textbooks that meet scope and sequence requirements for most introductory courses at accredited colleges and universities. Along the way, we found that many secondary school teachers were gravitating towards our products because of the accessibility, quality, and engaging ancillary materials. In continuing our mission to bring OER into every classroom, OpenStax has added K12 and research divisions which will allow us to continue using data to improve educational access in all grade levels. Currently, OpenStax offers Algebra 1 curriculum through RAISE, Rice Algebra Initiative for Succes and Equity, which is deployed primarily in middle school classrooms.

We are also supported by foundations such as the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation and <a href="https://openstax.org/foundation">other generous supporters</a>. Foundations give us the funding to create high quality, peer-reviewed textbooks that are written by paid educators and experts, not crowd sourced. OpenStax partners with for-profit companies (referred to as our Allies) that provide extra, optional instructional resources and courseware aligned and integrated with our textbooks. These companies give us a mission support fee in return for using our content, ultimately contributing to our sustainability. These mission support fees help ensure OpenStax textbooks are always up to date.</p>',
