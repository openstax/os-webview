Concepts are taught not just through text and figures, but also through animations and learning questions. Entire sections of text are thoughtfully reduced or replaced with these interactive modules. Animations help students visualize and understand key concepts. Learning questions engage students, walking them through concepts step-by-step, with thorough explanations of both right and wrong answers. A key benefit of interactivity is that students come to lecture more engaged. We partner with OpenStax titles by adding this critical layer of interactivity students demand to make the most use of their textbook.
