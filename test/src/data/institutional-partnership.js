The institutions are selected during a competitive application process in April of each year. Each institution admitted into the program creates an individualized strategic plan and then works with OpenStax to implement the plan. Monthly calls and emails with the cohort provide peer-to-peer support, guidance, and accountability.</p><p>The OpenStax Institutional Partner Program is for institutions ready to make an impact on campus by dedicating the necessary time and resources to motivate faculty and utilize OER to drive student success, retention, and completion.</p><p>Download <a href=\"http://example.com/brochure\">this brochure</a> for more details about the program.</p>",
