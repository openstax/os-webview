I was always an eager student and ready to learn, but my family’s low income created significant barriers to my ability to obtain an education. Today, I am a student at Houston Community College majoring in communications. My dream is to start a non-profit organization called The Beautiful Struggle which will provide financial, housing, and educational assistance to homeless and low income families and students with the ultimate goal of ensuring that fewer families fall victim to the vicious cycle of poverty.</i></p>',
